# DLRTracker
The purpose of this project is to determine the time that the DLR train will arrive at a selected station and display a countdown to arrival.

## Description
This project could have been done using AJAX request (XMLHttpRequest obeject) but the requests were handled serverside to practice use of express.js. This may be changed in the future with the express portion of the project handling log-in or other pages/calcs

## Upcoming improvements / To-do
    - Login system / cookies to remember user
    - Format re-design using better css techniques (flexbox / grid)
    - Possible move to ejs from pug
